Currently a PhD Resercher at University Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier in Toulouse France.

My thesis works concentrate about pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology within 2 countries (Vietnam and France). 

I have good experiences on Pharmacovigilance, Drug Safety, Drug Information, Clinical Pharmacology, Statistics and Modeling, Pharmaco-epidemiological Methodology, Data Mining.

My experience as a Data Scientist : 

  +	Data science experiences using R (with more than 3 years’ experience) and Python including: Data analysis and research design, Data coding, Data manipulation, Data visualization, Datamining in public health domain.
  +	Professional in using RStudio, RMarkdown, Latex, Cloud Services, Zotero, CSL coding to generate transparent and reproducible research
  +	Additional skills: Microsoft Office (Word, Power Point and Excel), scientific blogging, GIS analysis and display, Inkscape, Adobe Photoshop &Lightroom, etc.


This blog aims to share some of my experiences/research ideas during my thesis in the Regional pharmacovigilance Centre Midi-Pyreneans (Toulouse, France) and the National Centre of Drug Information and Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring (Hanoi, Vietnam).
